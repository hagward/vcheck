About:

  vcheck.py was written by KTH student Anders Hagward in 2010 to assist him in
  his learning of Japanese vocabulary. It is updated sporadically.

Usage:

  vcheck.py [-h] [-d [dir]] [-rand] [-switch] [filename [filename ...]]

  positional arguments:
    filename    name of the word file

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit
    -d [dir]    the directory to look for the word file(s)
    -rand       randomize the word list
    -switch     switch the two languages

    If the file extensions are omitted, vcheck will assume that they are '.txt'.
    It is also possible to not state any filenames at all, as vcheck then will
    try to load all the text files in the current, or specified, directory.

    The files containing the words are as previously stated regular text files.
    The foreign word and its translation are separated with a '|'. Word pairs
    are separated by newlines, i.e. one "word|translation" per line.
