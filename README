About:
  vcheck.py was written by KTH student Anders Hagward in 2010
  to help him practise his Japanese vocabulary. It is updated
  sporadically.

Usage:
  python vcheck.py [flags] [dir] [filename(s)]
  
  where 'dir' is the name of the directory containing the text
  files and the (optional) flags any of the ones below. If no
  filenames specified the program will load all files in the
  directory.
  
  Flags:
    -r -- 'randomize'; test the words in random order
    -s -- 'switch'; switch between the two languages
