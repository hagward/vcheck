About:
  vcheck.py was written by KTH student Anders Hagward in 2010 to assist him in
  his learning of Japanese vocabulary. It is updated sporadically.

Usage:
  python vcheck.py [-r] [-s] <dir> <filename(s)>
  
  -r            show the words in random order
  -s            switch between the two languages
  dir           the name of the directory containing the word files
  filename(s)   the name(s) of the word file(s)
  
  If the file extensions are omitted, vcheck will assume that they are '.txt'.
  It's also possible not to state any file names at all, as vcheck then will
  try to load all the text files in the specified directory.
